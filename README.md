# Chronic Illness Risk Prediction Tool

## Project Intro/Objective

With this tool I hope to help identify individuals who are at risk for chronic illnesses with information regarding individual's  health behaviors and other determinants of health such as access to healthcare, education and income. I used classification models on a Center for Disease Control (CDC) survey data to classify whether an individual is at risk of a chronic condition.

## Methods Used

Machine Learning - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Clustering

## Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter
- sklearn
- Plotly
- Matplot

## Data

I used The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. BRFSS is a telephone survey conducted by the CDC about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.
The BRFSS is a system of ongoing health-related telephone surveys designed to collect data on health-related
risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, health care access, and use of preventive services from the
adults residing in the United States.

BRFSS collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.

# Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create an automated tool that can classify whether an individual is at risk for a chronic illness and identify the top risk factors.
